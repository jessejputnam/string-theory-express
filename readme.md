## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View shop inventory stored on database
- View inventory by category
- View categories and items as linked items on the server
- Click items to add to cart
- View cart total on items
- Add, delete, update, and read all items

Programming focus:

- MVC architecture
- CRUD functionality with backend communication
- Connecting storefront to backend database for realtime inventory access
- Keeping frontend/backend inventory items/lists in sync
- Database queries
- Ensure items and categories reference one another for storefront traversal of related items

## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) - Frontend scripting language
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/en/) - Backend JavaScript runtime environment
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - Web framework for Node.js
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - NoSQL cloud database
- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) - MongoDB object modeling for Node.js

### What I learned

After working with React for so long, learning about the MVC architecture has made me rethink some of the ways that React makes interaction easier, but, that without strong patterns in place, the separation of concerns becomes muddled.

The Node/Express/Mongoose framework with the MVC architecture allowed for an easier mental model for where concerns flowed and what, at any given file, the purpose was.

### Continued Development

To add:

- Simulated shopping cart functionality
